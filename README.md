# LED-Blink-Rate
The goal of this homework is for students to write a program in MIPs that will control the LEDs blinking rate on a microcontroller. This project is conducted using interupts which allow for much better button press recognition than timers do.
All of the code is written in MIPs assembly language and is suggested to use MPLAB IDE for compilation.
